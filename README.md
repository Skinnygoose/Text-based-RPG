## **Features**
- **Interactive Decision-Making**: Players are presented with various accommodation options and other life decisions that impact their finances and mental health.
- **Dynamic Story Flow**: Based on the player's choices, the storyline progresses, with different branches for various outcomes.
- **Mental Stress and Money Bars**: Visual indicators show how each decision affects the player's well-being and finances.
- **Timer for Anxiety**: Players must make decisions under time pressure, and wrong or delayed choices result in additional stress and complex scenarios.
- **Branching Scenarios**: Each decision (e.g., staying in an Airbnb, with friends, or booking a hotel) has its own consequences, such as financial strain, mental health effects, or potential government penalties for working illegally.

## **Game Mechanics**
1. **Accommodation Choices**: Players begin the game by choosing how to secure temporary housing (e.g., Airbnb, staying with friends, hotel), and each choice influences future scenarios.
2. **Consequences of Decisions**:
   - **Expensive Accommodation**: Leads to high financial strain, forcing the player to work extra hours, which could impact their mental health or lead to legal consequences.
   - **Moderate Accommodation**: A balanced option that requires fewer working hours but might cause moderate stress.
   - **Low-Cost Accommodation**: Allows more time for studies but comes with poor living conditions, affecting mental health.
3. **Timer System**: When the player is asked to make a decision, a timer begins. If the timer runs out, the number of options increases, representing real-life anxiety.
